## software design document
a first attempt at a software design document 

## Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The gameing room assignment was for a fake client that wanted to translate their android based app into a web based one and were looking for help with the process and possible options.

## What did you do particularly well?
 I Feel I handled the idea of how an app like this should approach security with a good ethics approach.  

## What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I really need to work on getting back into writing java it is currently the weakest of the langauges that I familiar with. The design documnet however, really helps focus out what direction to take the project in.

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
 I would work on the evaluation section. I felt it was the weakest mostly because I feel the sections had some focus that would be out of scope for the project. To improve it i would tailor it more to what the project calls for and leave out sections that I feel are out of the question for the current project.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  In order to meet the needs here I focused on what the best practices were for todays market. I also wanted to use serverless technology to allow the project to grow with its user base. It is important to consider the user's needs in this case because the company wanted to have more outreach than just the limited android market. 


## How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached designing the software in a similar manner to the approaches I had to take during the General Assembly class because a web app design is close in the way it is made to how websites are also made. For future projects I hope to have fully built a react native app to have a bit more experience.
